# Google Cloud Platform - Notebook Demo

### Demo 1 - Notebook integration with Google Cloud Storage and BigQuery
Notebook that goes through some easy examples of how to integrate with GCS and BQ.

### Demo 2 - ETL with Dataflow (and Interactive Dataflow notebooks)
Notebook that shows how to create a ETL pipeline with Dataflow. This example reads a text file from GCS and performs some transformations on the data with the end goal of storing the data either as new file in GCS or directly into a table in BQ. 

### Demo 3 - BigQueryML for ML Training, Evaluation and Inference
This notebook show how to connect and run ML jobs in BQ uring the embedded ML features. It also goes through some of the ML features included in BQ as well as show how to perform batch inference. 

### Demo 4 - BigQueryML with Transformation
This notebook goes through how to add and use the Transformation feature in BQ.

### Demo 5 - AI Platform Training (Local, Gcloud and GCP)
Here we go through how to train a custom model in AI Platform Training using the SDK. 

### Demo 6 - AI Platform Training with Pre-built Algorithms
In this notebook we use a Pre-built algorithm within AI Platform to train the model. 

### Demo 7 - AI Platform AutoML Tables with Structured Data
This notebook focuses on using AutoML Tables to train a classification model using the Tables client library. 

### Demo 8 - AI Platform Predictions
Here we deploy a model to AI Platform Predictions and perform a simple online inference. 

### Demo 9 - AI Platform Pipelines
In this notebook we set up and build a ML pipline using AI Platform Pipelines (based on Kubeflow) using Python Lightweight components. 

### Demo 10 - Simple Scikit-learn Logistic Regression Example
This notebook shows a simple example using scikit-learn to create a logistic regression model

### Demo 12 - ML Pipeline Example with Cloud Composer and BigQuery ML
Here we show how to create a machine learning pipeline including BQ transformations, model training and evaluation.
